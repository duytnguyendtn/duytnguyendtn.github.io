# My 7800 Mile EV Roadtrip - Charging was the Easiest Part!
What's stopping you from going fully electric? Not *hybrid* but **fully** electric? I don't mean this as a trick question to try and corner you; any answer to this question is a legitimate reason you are allowed to have! Rather I'd like you to honestly take a moment and think about **your** answer to this question. The one that ranks highest in my book is the extraordinary high cost as a barrier to entry (come on Elon, give us that $25k Tesla already!). But there are infinitely more out there!

If your primary concern is about range or charging, you might be interested on how I accomplished a 7800 mile EV roadtrip in my Tesla Model 3. At the very least, what allowed me to seamlessly travel Cross Country without any range anxiety might help you decide what's important to shop for when you look for your first (or next) EV.

## Hang Loose, Dude! ðŸ¤™
Whenever I talk about my visit to Hawaii, the one thing I talk to everyone about is not the sunny weather, the wonderful beaches, or the delicious seafood. The first thing I tell people, and the one aspect I repeatedly reminisce about with others who have been to the island, is the pure culture of chill that permeates the entire state. In my discussions with one of those friends, and also one who also had a long history of roadtrips, this was the one piece that we agreed on as the absolute essential that defines how you will enjoy the trip: Roadtrips are truly what you make of it.

My suspicion is anyone can go electric if they simply adopt this one rule. Indeed, I think a lot of us can gain a lot by relaxing a bit and encorporating a shaka throughout our lives, but this especially rings true of owning an electric vehicle.
