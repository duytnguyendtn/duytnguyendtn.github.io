# Hi there!

My name is Duy Nguyen (pronounced /`zwi/ or "Zwee"), and I'm an astronomy nerd! My profession is as an open-source, astronomical software engineer, currently developing data analysis tools for the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes! In my free time, I'm an avid astrophotographer, and love stargazing! In other corners, I do various volunteer work surrounding LGBTQIA+ rights and activism! I'm also really invested in human longevity research, trying to defeat the disease of aging. Please don't hesitate to reach out and chat; I love meeting new people! You can find me in any of the below places!
