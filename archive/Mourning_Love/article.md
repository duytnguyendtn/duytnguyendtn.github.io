# Mourning Love

"I use the piano as a tool," my friend told me. "I just don't play piano."

"What do you mean??" I asked, genuinely not understanding his words. "When someone loves a tool, usually they use it to make something, right?"

"No, that's just it. I'm sad I could never *just* play something. I've spent so long studying music itself, *how* music sounds pleasing to people. I can tell you all about modes, leading voices, and how to construct chords, but I couldn't play anything for you right now, and that's sad."

"Oh, so it's like using a woodcarving kit to study woodcarving, studying the shapes of the blades, and how people use them to create, but never actually creating anything yourself?"

"Precisely."

It was during a cold, Boston evening cherishing a friend where I let myself grieve the loss of love.

## Delusion Deludes
/* Talk about how I deluded myself into "Just focus on building connections, and if something comes, it will come." How I told myself I was happy with all the friendships I was forming while ignoring the unshakable hole in me, just saying if I got enough friends, it will most certainly close, when it never did. Most strengths and weaknesses are related */

/* Also talk about feeling like a pet to everyone: a bubbly, optimistic, happy person to be around, but never to be taken seriously (Second best friend)*/

It happend quietly. There was no fanfare, no weeping, no tears (society beat that out of me decades ago). It happeed in an intimate setting with my good college friend, just the two of us over a piano in the quiet student lounge of his dorm. In fact, he was almost certainly none-the-wiser, as I didn't say anything outloud about my thoughts. To him, we were most definitely talking about music, about our mutual love of the piano, just from opposite extremes; but most certainly not about love itself.

I've been burned by love before, not many times, but it only takes one severe burn to leave you with a lifetime of scars.

I've always thought aromantic-asexual people were the coolest people in the world; to not need a lick of validation from anyone for anything, just to be fully content with themselves was a level of confidence I always wished I could aspire to, but never could quite attain. I only have a glimpse of how cool it must feel because I'm half of it. It took me a while figure out I was asexual, but once I did, realizing everyone else viewed sex differently made it feel so... exhausting. The way I heard people describe their endless chase for gratification, to satisfy that primal urge, and the withdrawl symptoms they'd have when they lose access to it, it just felt so tiring. I've never related to that, and honestly I'm happy I don't! And to hear both physical and emotional risks that evidently are just... normal to most people, almost make me grateful I was born this way. 

Yet, I've always known I was a hopeless romantic; it was something I knew about myself going back to middle school. I yearned to find someone who I knew would always be there for me, who I could wrap my arms around, bury my face into, and feel safe. 

## Asking an alcoholic to a bar


"Oh don't worry, you'll find someone," they'll say. "You're such a good person with great qualities, someone will fall for you." But the truth is, unless they're claiming to be psychics, my friends don't know that (and if they are, maybe I need to reevaluate my friendships). Though good-spirited attempts to try and make me feel better, they are, ultimately, unfounded promises that ignore the thinking part of my brain and just try to soothe my emotional side who is clearly in pain. I'm grateful to my friends who will read this and want to try and soothe my aching heart. They care for me and don't want to see me hurting.

But the truth of the matter is love is such a matter of luck and chance; it's not a guarantee. I love talking about karma as much as the next, but no one really "deserves" anything in this life. Reality is cruel and unfair all the time (and I reject the premise of a higher power working in mysterious ways). And saying this as an asexual, dangling this carrot in front of us only serves to distract us from living our lives and chasing other things that ARE within our control. I have so many people who I do know care about me and such limited time and energy in this life to invest into I can't afford any distractions. I hate that love can make me feel sad and depressed, preventing me, for even a second, from seeing the world for what it is: a beautiful place with beautiful people with so many beautiful things to see.

I'm not giving up on love; I've heard the story of people finding love just as they give up on it so many times; I'm aware of the irony here. This letter only serves to declare I am done searching. From here, I will make every decision based on reality in front of me, rather than the hope of what could be. I also am not rejecting/suppressing my romantic self; I feel the hole in my heart and will carry it for the rest of my life if I have to; I acknowledge it and witness it. My heart will aimlessly travel through spacetime searching for someone who can make me feel whole. But life is full of compromises and no one escapes this life with everything going exactly the way they want, even amongst those who DO find romantic relationships; compromise is such a strong tenant of successful relationships after all. I can't afford to be distracted. I can't be burdened searching for something that may never pay off. This is as close to the "unsubscribe" button as I can get, as an alloromantic. This will be my cross to bear, maybe my entire life, maybe not, but at least for now.

At least I tried. https://open.spotify.com/track/36gKeSF6K1y2t5Aj23DZqz
