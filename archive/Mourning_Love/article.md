# Mourning Love

"I use the piano as a tool," my friend told me. "I just don't play piano."

"What do you mean??" I asked, genuinely not understanding his words. "When someone loves a tool, usually they use it to make something, right?"

"No, that's just it. I'm sad I could never *just* play something. I've spent so long studying music itself, *how* music sounds pleasing to people. I can tell you all about modes, leading voices, and how to construct chords, but I couldn't play anything for you right now, and that's sad."

"Oh, so it's like using a woodcarving kit to study woodcarving, studying the shapes of the blades, and how people use them to create, but never actually creating anything yourself?"

"Precisely."

It was during a cold, Boston evening cherishing a friend where I let myself grieve the loss of love.

## Delusion Deludes

It happend quietly. There was no fanfare, no weeping, no tears (society beat that out of me decades ago). It happeed in an intimate setting with my good college friend, just the two of us over a piano in the quiet student lounge of his dorm. In fact, he was almost certainly none-the-wiser, as I didn't say anything outloud about my thoughts. To him, we were most definitely talking about music, about our mutual love of the piano, just from opposite extremes; but most certainly not about love.

I've always thought aromantic-asexual people were the coolest people in the world; to not need a lick of validation from anyone for anything, just to be fully content with themselves was a level of confidence I always wished I could aspire to, but never could quite attain. I only have a glimpse of how cool it must feel because I'm half of it. It took me a while figure out I was asexual, but once I did, realizing everyone else viewed sex differently made it feel so... exhausting. The way I heard people describe their endless chase for gratification, to satisfy that primal urge, and the withdrawl symptoms they'd have when they lose access to it, it just felt so tiring. I've never related to that, and honestly I'm happy I don't! And to hear both physical and emotional risks that evidently are just... normal to most people, almost make me grateful I was born this way. 

Yet, I've always known I was a hopeless romantic; it was something I knew about myself going back to middle school. I yearned to find someone who I knew would always be there for me, who I could wrap my arms around, bury my face into, and feel safe. I've been burned by love before, not many times, but it only takes one severe burn to leave you with a lifetime of scars. Oh the irony of needing the very thing that has caused you the biggest pain in your life. 

Coming out of that all-consuming relationship, I found myself feeling isolated, alone. Having committed myself to my partner with every fiber in my being left me in a field of wilted flowers, people, and relationships I had long abandoned for the cause. I came out shell-shocked; this is what love made me do.

Disgusting.

Despite everything that happened, when the person I cared for most kicked me into the pit of despair, those long abandoned people were the ones who ultimately caught me despite the years of neglect. In that moment, I saw just how deluded I had been and realized who really mattered in my life. And now with boundless time at my disposal, I've commited the last four years of my life to one thing: connecting deeply with my friends and family, and growing my social sphere. It was my way of honoring the connections that ultimately saved me when I needed them most.

## Making Connection

I wish I could say, "and then I just did it," but the reality was this was new to me; as another friend put it, I needed to build my "social muscle." I couldn't expect having done the social equivalent of sitting on the couch for three years eating potato chips that I could immediately go and bench press 200 pounds! As an academic, I did what I did best and studied. There is a surprising wealth of scientific studies on the loneliness epidemic, and, yes, it took pouring through academic literature to actually get me to understand the fundamental principles of friendship:

1. Give friendships more priority in your life; make them feel that you care.
2. Check in with friends and regularly go to things to have fun; create those opportunities if they don't exist.
3. Show genuine interest in others and give them the opportunity to know you without selling yourself too hard.

-- Kurzgesagt "How to Make Friends"

I made the conscious decision to transform my life around these three principles. I dragged my introverted butt into places I'd never been, kept meticulous notes on all my friends interests and people who mattered in their lives, and said yes to every invitation that flowed my way.

And, in short, it worked. Earlier this year, I sent a letter to two very close friends who were there for me at the beginning and had wrapped me into their friend group, reflecting on how much my life had changed. In that weekend, I counted 25 distinct people I knew by name and genuinely cared for that I shared life and laughter with. My calendar and availability is starting to become the limiting factor to inviting more people into my life, to much chagrin of my introverted self.

And if this were a story about friendships, this would be the end of the success story. But this is a story about love.

## The Ulterior Motive

/* Also talk about feeling like a pet to everyone: a bubbly, optimistic, happy person to be around, but never to be taken seriously (Second best friend)*/

While, objectively, this *is* what happened, I only recently recognized the reactionary nature of my behavior back then. I didn't *really* go to my friends searching for support; I *found* myself being supported by them. It was precisely that they caught me without me even asking that I felt so profoundly moved to reform my life in their honor.

But AS I was falling into that pit, before I was caught by my friends, the first question I asked my therapist wasn't about them.

"How can I possibly find someone else, after all of this?"

On one hand, it is kind of expected I would still be thinking in terms of romance considering I hadn't reformed my way of thinking just yet, but I think it really does speak to the fact I find so frustrating, that I am not aromantic. As much as I wish I were, I can't avoid that fact. Silently, even as I started to reform my perspective, I have to admit I still was thinking about romance strategically, that "if I put myself out there to connect with people, then maybe as I'm making friends, someone will stand out to me and romance will happen naturally as well?"

And, in short, it worked. It took longer, but I eventually found someone who I connected with on such a unique level, we both saw just how amazingly magnetic we were attracted to each other. With similar identities and shared heritage, I felt seen in ways that I had never felt before. Despite only knowing each other for a few months, our bond grew further than many other connections I made who had double or triple the marinade time.

## Romance Withdrawl

Unfortunately for me, the romance part was unrequited.

Even as I grew my friendship sphere and allowed myself to be vulnerable around my group of trusted friends, the void in my heart was unshakable, as if I were still missing a part of me. As I struggled to find someone that quite fit "the bill," I just told myself, "Just focus on building connection. If romance comes, trust it will come. Connection is important for romance, so don't let the end goal distract you from your job now." And as I started shifting my priorities towards building friendships, I deluded myself to think "Well, as your friends are starting to fill that role, maybe if I get enough friends, the hole will most certainly close."

It most certainly did not.

Ostensibly, the primary thing I feared in that confession was losing them as a friend; our connection was, and still is, much more important to me than the prospects of any romantic developments. And I thank the fates I still have that. But despite having that, because of this thing called "love," I now have to sit here and grieve. The *healthy* path here is to allow myself to anguish in sorrow while I allow the emotion to run its course.

"In order to have the good, you have to have the bad. Emotions come as package deals; it's only because you can feel bad that you can feel good. Emotionless robots can't have either." Believe me, I know this and understand it deeply; it's something I had to bash into my head constantly during my recovery from my previous relationship. It's not necessarily the grief *itself* that upsets me. I'm upset that grief prevents me from seeing all the lovely things I *know* are still there. The world I see around myself right now is grayscale, but I *know* the color is still there. All the things I enjoy doing are still here to bring joy into my life. I have so many people who care about me, and that I care for. I still have someone I was able to be vulnerable with AND still get to keep in my life; there is so much beauty in that.

Yet, my grief refuses to acknowledge any of that. My grief demands an audience to mourn the delusions of my hopes and dreams, delusions IT CREATED. It demands the spotlight and soils the world around me.

Why? What's the point of this? I have so much to do in this life, so much fun to have, so many people's company to enjoy. I could easily build a fulfilling and purposeful life around these elements; why was I created to be trapped in this rat race towards something that doesn't need to be in that list? The fact that my delusions of love are calling me to curl up in my bed and cry surrounded by a beautiful world is so...

Disgusting.

## Asking an alcoholic to a bar

"Oh don't worry, you'll find someone," they'll say. "You're such a good person with great qualities, someone will fall for you." I'm grateful to my friends who will want to try and soothe my aching heart. They care for me and don't want to see me hurting. But the truth is, unless they're claiming to be psychics, my friends don't know that (and if they are, maybe I need to reevaluate my friendships). Though good-spirited attempts to try and make me feel better, they are, ultimately, unfounded promises that ignore the thinking part of my brain and just try to soothe my emotional side in pain.

The truth of the matter is love is such a matter of luck and chance; it's not a guarantee. Perhaps I am destined to be like my fiend and the piano. Having studied how we make connection and relationships, there's clear, causal actions that foster connection and how to build great friendships with people, that much is clear. I studied it, implemented it, and reaped the rewards of it. Based on my own anecdotal experience, there may even be a causal actions on how to fall in love.

However, the uncomfortable truth seems to be despite the millenia of generations of human experimentation, Humanity seems to have not yet cracked the code on how romance *works*, other than just vague shrugs about "communication". Or if we have, the uncountable accounts of trauma, abuse, relationship bickers/arguments, divorce, and unrequited love that is so pervasive in our society at least suggests we're not listening! The secret seems to be inordinate amounts of work to try and make it work, is what makes it work. It's the sheer stubbornness to stumble around the dark, get beaten and bruised, but delude yourself to keep going that's the only true indicator of relational success.

Just like my friend who has studied piano to no end, I may be destined to never play a song again. I'll know music and observe its beauty from afar, but never with my own fingertips. I love talking about karma as much as the next, but no one really "deserves" anything in this life. Reality is cruel and unfair all the time (and I reject the premise of a higher power working in mysterious ways). And saying this as an asexual, dangling this carrot in front of us only serves to distract us from living our lives to the fullest and chasing other things that ARE within our control. I have so many people who I do know care about me and such limited time and energy in this life to invest into; I can't afford any distractions. I hate that love can make me feel sad and depressed, preventing me, for even a second, from seeing the world for what it is: a beautiful place with beautiful people with so many beautiful things to see.

I'm not giving up on love; I've heard the story of people finding love just as they give up on it so many times; I'm aware of the irony here. This letter only serves to declare I am done searching. From here, I will make every decision based on reality in front of me, rather than the hope of what could be. I also am not rejecting/suppressing my romantic self; I feel the hole in my heart and will carry it for the rest of my life if I have to; I acknowledge it and witness it. My heart will aimlessly travel through spacetime searching for someone who can make me feel whole. But life is full of compromises and no one escapes this life with everything going exactly the way they want, even amongst those who DO find romantic relationships; compromise is such a strong tenant of successful relationships after all.

I can't afford to be distracted. I can't be burdened searching for something that may never pay off. This is as close to the "unsubscribe" button as I can get, as an alloromantic. This will be my cross to bear, maybe my entire life, maybe not, but at least for now.

At least I tried. https://open.spotify.com/track/36gKeSF6K1y2t5Aj23DZqz
