# Vulnerability - From Fearing the World to Embracing it
Never post online until after vacation. Leave a light on in the kitchen whenever you leave the house. Save every receipt for the IRS. Always remember to save for retirement. Tear every piece of mail with your address. These are but a few pieces of advice I've gotten from my parents growing up. Naturally, being a child, I never questioned them; the threats made sense. Someone *could* dive through the garbage to get my address. The IRS *could* audit us at any time. A hacker *could* see when we were gone on vacation and rob our house with ease. At the time, it was easy advice to follow: just do these things and you'll be safe. I credited my own family's privilege and luck to this forward-seeking mentality.

Then, as I started to see the world through my own eyes, not just through my parents', I saw all the world had to fear.

It wasn't just the social media posts. People talk! What if a friend of mine who knows my vacation plans tells a friend, who tells a hacker! Humans can solve puzzles! What if a dumpster diver finds all the pieces of my torn address and reassembles them! If each dollar I invest multiplies, why wouldn't I save every single cent I make? It was all possible! I had to protect myself, and my family! One wrong mistake could theoretically ruin my life!

## Everyone's Second Best Friend
Through my formative years of my young adulthood, I found myself taking my parents' advice and cranking it to 11. I would tear my junk mail into tiny shreds by hand and scatter them across different trash cans. I reserved my plans and exact details to only those who were joining me, or who needed to know; anyone else could be a leakers. I hoarded every record until my desk overflowed with papers and receipts. I never signed up for any social media and swore it off as a platform to hand your lives over to the bots, scrapers, and governments' spying eyes. The only people I got close to were those I had direct business with, that being classes, clubs, or other groups. Naturally, I compartmentalized my friends and info streams accordingly. Over my short life, I've managed over 25 different email addresses I've made for different reasons.

I wasn't entirely socially-inept; I had what I'd consider as healthy friend groups and I had positive and engaging friendships. Yet simultaneously as I was making these changes, I saw my friends get close with each other in ways that didn't compute to me. When I took inventory of who was inviting who on a regular basis, which social "clicks" existed, I found myself outside of most, if not all, of them. It was almost as if I were an ambassador between all the different clicks; like I was everyone's second best friend. I'm still piecing this together, but maybe as a defense mechanism, I developed a three-tiered structure of privilege between me, and the world.
* Tier 1 - These people knew everything about me and my life; reserved for my immediate family and, eventually, significant other.
* Tier 2 - Those here received information on an as-needed basis. Each person or group was compartmentalized into whatever connection I had with those people.
* Tier 3 - Absolute exclusion; these people did not know me, and I don't know them. There is no reason why these people should ever know any detail of my life. After all, I derive no benefit from someone I don't know being aware of my presense.  

## The Patriot Act, and Google, Enforcing my Paranoia
According to different sources, I'm either the youngest millenial, or the oldest Gen-Z'er. Regardless, I only barely remember my days before the TSA, and have lived my whole life with access to the internet. Right when I was beginning to think for myself, Edward Snowden happened. Then, very soon after, tech giants' data collection schemes started to become household topics. In my college years, Cambridge Analytica happened. AI caught fire and then there was Clearview.AI. Deepfakes continue to get better and better, and Chinese citizens are literally dying to protest against the surveillance state. Seemingly, every other business was experiencing data hacks and leaks, even hitting a US presidential candidate. If you were looking for any reason to be concerned for your data privacy, the news seems to have a limitless amount of stories to keep you awake at night.

It didn't help that in the tech world, it feels like a noble cause to carefully guard your private data. In fact, there exists a whole counter movement to push back against these data-collection machines. In fact, data privacy is often touted as one of the fundamental pillars of FOSS (Free Open Source Software) that I now find myself employed in. There's a whole abundance of FOSS Linux Firewalls, deGoogle'd Android distributions, privacy-oriented internet browsers, and tracking-preventing extensions. I know, because I've looked.

The further I looked, the more the message seemed to double-down (anchor?) on the idea that being paranoid about your privacy was a good thing. There were countless self-help articles touting the benefits of a social-media detox; research even came out showing higher rates of anxiety and depression linked with social media use. #DeleteFacebook was, and still is, raging throughout social media. 

## Overturning the Impacts of War
As I began unpacking my paranoia with my therapist, I started to realize why my parents instilled those values into me growing up; I started to see their perspective, and it totally made sense. (Reeducation camps, trying to flee vietnam, people being captured, keep quiet, boat people, everyone bringing supplies, some getting caught)

## From "Can't" to "Won't"
(Friends can't judge me because they dont' have any info. > Friends won't judge me because they know who I truly am)
