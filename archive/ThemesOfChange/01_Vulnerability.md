# Vulnerability - From Fearing the World to Embracing it
Never post online until after vacation. Leave a light on in the kitchen whenever you leave the house. Save every receipt for the IRS. Always remember to save for retirement. Tear every piece of mail with your address. These are but a few pieces of advice I've gotten from my parents growing up. Naturally, being a child, I never questioned them; the threats made sense. Someone *could* dive through the garbage to get my address. The IRS *could* audit us at any time. A hacker *could* see when we were gone on vacation and rob our house with ease. At the time, it was easy advice to follow: just do these things and you'll be safe. I credited my own family's privilege and luck to this forward-seeking mentality.

Then, as I started to see the world through my own eyes, not just through my parents', I saw all the world had to fear.

It wasn't just the social media posts. People talk! What if a friend of mine who knows my vacation plans tells a friend, who tells a hacker! Humans can solve puzzles! What if a dumpster diver finds all the pieces of my torn address and reassembles them! If each dollar I invest multiplies, why wouldn't I save every single cent I make? It was all possible! I had to protect myself, and my family! One wrong mistake could theoretically ruin my life!

## Everyone's Second Best Friend
Through my formative years of my young adulthood, I found myself taking my parents' advice and cranking it to 11. I would tear my junk mail into tiny shreds by hand and scatter them across different trash cans. I reserved my plans and exact details to only those who were joining me, or who needed to know; anyone else could be a leakers. I hoarded every record until my desk overflowed with papers and receipts. I never signed up for any social media and swore it off as a platform to hand your lives over to the bots, scrapers, and governments' spying eyes. The only people I got close to were those I had direct business with, that being classes, clubs, or other groups. Naturally, I compartmentalized my friends and info streams accordingly and NEVER cross-contaminated the privileged info streams. Over my short life, I've managed over 25 different email addresses I've made for different reasons.

I wasn't entirely socially-inept; I had what I'd consider as healthy friend groups and I had positive and engaging friendships. Yet simultaneously as I was making these changes, I saw my friends get close with each other in ways that didn't compute to me. When I took inventory of who was inviting who on a regular basis, which social "clicks" existed, I found myself outside of most, if not all, of them. It was almost as if I were an ambassador between all the different clicks, still a great friend to hang out with, but not part of the "in-group"; like I was everyone's second best friend. I'm still piecing this together, but maybe as a defense mechanism, I developed a three-tiered structure of privilege between me, and the world.
* Tier 1 - These people knew everything about me and my life, the highest level of trust; reserved for my immediate family and, eventually, significant other.
* Tier 2 - Those here received information on an as-needed basis. Each person or group was compartmentalized into whatever connection I had with those people.
* Tier 3 - Absolute exclusion; these people did not know me, and I don't know them. There is no reason why these people should ever know any detail of my life. After all, I derive no benefit from strangers I don't know being aware of my presense.  

## The Patriot Act, and Google, Enforcing my Paranoia
According to different sources, I'm either the youngest millenial, or the oldest Gen-Z'er. Regardless, I only barely remember my days before the TSA, and have lived my whole life with access to the internet. Right when I was beginning to think for myself, Edward Snowden happened. Then, very soon after, tech giants' data collection schemes started to become household topics. In my college years, Cambridge Analytica happened. AI caught fire and then there was Clearview.AI. Deepfakes continue to get better and better, and Chinese citizens are literally dying to protest against the surveillance state. Seemingly, every other business was experiencing data hacks and leaks, even hitting a US presidential candidate. If you were looking for any reason to be concerned for your data privacy, society seemed to have a limitless amount of stories to keep you awake at night.

It didn't help that in the tech world, it feels like a noble cause to carefully guard your private data. In fact, there exists a whole counter movement to push back against these data-collection machines. In fact, data privacy is often touted as one of the fundamental pillars of FOSS (Free Open Source Software) that I now find myself employed in, and still believe in. There's a whole abundance of FOSS Linux Firewalls, deGoogle'd Android distributions, privacy-oriented internet browsers, and tracking-preventing extensions. I know, because I've looked.

The further I looked, the more the message seemed to double-down (anchor?) on the idea that being paranoid about your privacy was a good thing. There were countless self-help articles touting the benefits of a social-media detox; research even came out showing higher rates of anxiety and depression linked with social media use. #DeleteFacebook was, and still is, raging throughout Twitter (ironically). 

## Overturning the Impacts of War
As I began unpacking my paranoia with my therapist, I started to realize why my parents instilled those values into me growing up; I started to see their perspective, and it totally made sense. Both of them were refugees from the Vietnam War; their experiences of fleeing a collapsing government and fearing a foreign ruler is an experience I hope never to share with them. While my Mother's story is a lot more steady, as a stowaway on a Navy ship, my Father's was anything but. As the story is told, the North Vietnamese Communist Regime instituted "reeducation camps" to "enlighten" the corrupted democratic South to the superior ways of the North. My Ong Ba Noi (Father's parents), as southern democratic political and religious activists, were among the "privileged" to attend these camps. The Northern Regime did not even hesitate to tear apart my family, leaving my 14-year-old father to tend, alone, to his three younger bothers, the youngest still being a toddler. Once my father was old enough, he, like many Southern Vietnamese, attempted to flee the country he called home. Those without means to be smuggled out usually resorted to take fishing boats out in the dead of night to flee to a neighboring country, or to be rescued by another boat under a different flag. However, the Northern Regime was aware of this tactic, and regularly used armed patrols and spies to intercept those trying to flee the country. As such, absolute secrecy was the only key to a successful escape. Preparations were divided between all the passengers to slowly accumulate supplies, from food to fuel. Attempting to purchase a large quantity all at once would be a sure-fire red flag to anyone curious enough to be listening. Even with all these precautions, when the group assembled late at night in the marsh fields designated as the rendezvous point, certain passengers, and their supplies were missing, having been caught, captured, and interrogated. Calling the trip off would only increase the chances of suspicion pointing too close; the trip had to continue. As you imagine this story in your head, there's one small detail I didn't mention. My father's anecdotal account was that only 20% of these voyages ended up successful. The other 4 of every 5 boats ended in capture, or death as the small fishing boat collapsed in international waters. Yet, for millions of Vietnamese citizens, such risk was so much worth it compared to what the Northern Regime was doing to their country. It's no wonder why my dad asked me to hide my home address; doing so probably saved his life. 

I still find it crazy to actually type this out; part of me refuses to believe it. My parents did everything in their power to give my siblings and I the life they never got to have: to pursue a life of limitless opportunity, only restricted by determination. To live an **easy** life without any and all danger; because they knew what **real** danger was; they lived it. Because of this, as I grew up in my 4000 square-foot home in my affluent, suburban community, enriching myself through afterschool clubs and study programs, I felt *no different* than my friends around me. Because of my privilege, before I entered high school, I had already cruised, visited more than half-a-dozen countries, and had nearly every privilege I wanted handed to me on a silver platter.

It's this perspective that paints the disagreements between me and my folks.

## The Road Less Traveled
I have *never* doubted that my parents wanted the best life for my siblings and I. My home was filled with love and devotion in every corner. This didn't mean I never argued with them; I have yet to run into a family unit that doesn't have their share of squabbles. For me, a lot of them arose around critical life-decisions; because I had every opportunity in the world, I felt empowered to take on the world in any way I wanted. As such, there were certain checkpoints throughout my life that was met with varying degrees to questioning to outright disapproval:
* Pursuing a degree in science rather than engineering
* Saying "No" to single-use freebies (plastic silverware, ketchup packets, hotel soap)
* Moving to a rural community where wifi, microwaves, and cell service were not allowed (Link to Green Bank)
* Falling in love with someone with severe mental illness

It's only recently, after months of therapy and self-reflection, did I notice what these issues shared: they weren't the **easiest** path. From my perspective, it didn't matter; they were what I cared for in my life, what made me tick, what motivated me in life. I knew these other options existed, but because I had "no bad options" on my privileged plate of limitless opportunity, I had the space to be choosey and decide for myself what would make me happy, even if it took more work, money, or time.

I now see that wasn't how my parents saw it. It didn't compute why I would choose to commit to a lower-paying career path that required a decade of commited study and hard work while another higher-paying career with no graduate school required was an option I was still considering. It sounded insane to them why I would even consider a career with a salary in the bottom 10% of my field while also requiring I give up features of the modern world that they risked their lives to afford to me. If there are billions of fish in the sea, why would I choose the one that was slowly making me miserable? (Okay, maybe they had a point about that one...)

Because I required myself to have a defense for every question and criticism thrown my way, I came up with hundereds of desperate attempts at "logical" reasons and justifications for my decisions; none of which were correct. But now, I think I have my fully developed answer for these sorts of questions now: I am cognizantly choosing the harder path in life because it will make me happier than the benefits afforded to me from choosing the other. Because of my family, because of **them**, I live a position of privilege that has given me everything I could possibly want from life; I have *enough*. Would I happily accept more if it came for free? Of course I would! But very rarely does any decision come without cost somewhere, whether that's to my happiness, the environment, or to others less fortunate. And in those scenarios, I'm content enough with the decision I'm going to make (or at least to the best of my current ability. And isn't life about following your gut, and learning from when it takes you astray?)

# From the Mekong to Washington DC 
*(TODO: Come up with a better title. Trying to show ridiculousness of equating Vietnam warzone to sleepy suburbs of DC)*
Vulnerability has afforded me benefits in life I never thought were possible. Going beyond not stressing about shredding my junk mail and recycling it to give the environment a break, learning to share my life with others has been a fundamental pivot in my life that has brought my relationships with all my friends and family so much choser. It has fostered trust and belonging to degrees I have never felt, and it feels amazing to feel loved, trusted, and supported by so many people who see me genuinely for who I am, and still love me for it.

Going through this pivot, I've found my answer to remove the shackles of paranoia I developed from my childhood, and move towards a life free of its constant fears. Yes, doing these things undoubtably saved my parents' lives and afforded them opportunities that were 100% better than anything the alternative could offer, but not every solution is appropriate for every context. I failed to see the simple reality that my sleepy suburb is not a warzone. I don't have a government who is coming to persecute me, despite what the politicians say. There is zero chance any of my friends are communist spies that are going to turn me in. Yes, being vulnerable and putting your shields down does put you at risk for those scenarios I painted before; they *are* certainly theoretically possible. However, I was blind to think that this security didn't also come with a cost: close relationships are built upon trust and openness. By living my life in accordance to the same values my parents used to survive their experience, I inadvertently had painted my environment in an equivalent light as theirs, to cast the shadow of mistrust onto my friends as threats or spies to my livelihood, no matter how ridiculous the claim. My friends are **NOT** a threat to my livelihood, and to paint them as such only serves to limit our capacity to grow as deep friends in a manner that honors the care we genuinely do have in each other.

## From "Can't" to "Won't"
My manifestation of this paranoia can truly be distilled to a single-word technicality; one small word change in my diction that truly embodied my absolute fear of vulnerability. So long as a risk was theoretically possible, I was hellbent over eliminating the possibility; not reduce, but to make it an impossibility. That's why I limited who had access to what information; once it was out there, it couldn't be taken back. People can't judge me negatively if they don't have any information to judge against. When I reckoned with the reality that information was how others got close to one another, it felt as if I was standing at the edge of a cliff. Since I could remember, I had been convinced jumping would simply result in my swift and efficient demise. The familiar made sense; it comforted me. Just stay as far from the cliff as you could, it told me, and whatever you did, do not take the irreversible decision and jump. Simultaneously though, familiarity couldn't answer all my questions I developed over my life. Now, with all these questions, I heard a new voice that seemed to have all the answers. It promised me everything I had been missing. All it cost was one small thing...
All I had to do was jump.
Who was the siren? What did they want? Was this voice trying to save me from my own prison, or was I being tempted towards a miscalculated, desperate escape by my insecurities? As I found myself at the precipice of all my fears, I looked back at my "cliff of safety" I was conditioned to know as my utopia. I was suddenly overwhelmed by the weight of all my pain I had been carrying over my life. The constant fear, the pressure to never mess up, the paranoia of others, this is no way to live my life. It was costing me my sanity, as I strived to embody the unattainable ideals and punished me when I predictably fell short. I didn't know what was at the bottom of the cliff, but I knew I couldn't stay here. As I held my foot over the edge, familiarity whispered one last time: *What if they're devils?* Without looking back, in an attempt to feel strong and hide the fact I was actually shaking, I answered back, "What if they're not?" and let myself slip past all I knew, as my "utopia" fell from my view for the first time in my life. I allowed the darkness to envelop me, as I braced for what familiarity told me would be my end...

but ultimately my journey wasn't long. Just as the cliff went out of sight, My fall was cushioned by another, although distant, familiarity. I looked around me and saw myself in the arms of my friends and family I loved most. It turns out they were waiting for me this whole time to take that leap.
I had been so busy keeping them at a distance, I completely missed the devotion and love they had for me. It wasn't a matter of preventing them from betraying me, it was showing them that I would never be the person who
(Friends can't judge me because they dont' have any info. > Friends won't judge me because they know who I truly am)

## What Even is a 'Best Friend'?

## A Small World Getting Bigger
(reflections taught me empathy, my struggles were a mini manifestation of what they are going through now. shrinking social circles because lose connecting tissue. heart goes to parents, as we are all they have, as their tier one family dies around them, opposite of the "shrinking world" feeling of my roadtrip (link to roadtrip reflections), why people grow more conservative as they age, where echo chambers come from?)
