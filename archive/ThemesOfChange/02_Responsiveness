# Seasonal Theme: Responsiveness
In my season of vulnerability, I found a wealth of friends and family around me whom supported me through the hardest period of my life. As I opened up to them, I felt my connections growing stronger, and my relationships blossoming in ways I never felt before. For this, I am forever indebted to the kindness, commitment, and friendship of each one of them.

As I carefully begin to stand on my own again, I carry around this newfound commitment I have to them and our relationships. I felt it only natural that as my Season of Vulernability drew to a close, that my attention shift towards them. One character flaw I've been acutely aware of is my social-inattentiveness, which is a fancy way of saying I don't catch onto subtle hints or signals. (expand here)

I realized by enforcing my direct language pattern onto others, I have not been respecting their pattern of communication and, ironically, have been blinding myself to even trying to begin developing this skill by sticking my head into the sand. No more of this; I wanted to see my friends for who they are, which includes their voice, despite how frustrating my flaws would make it for me. Their voice was just as important and valuable as my own, and they deserved to be heard; it was my job to listen.
